Hyper Text Markup Language 

HTML is used to design structure of a webpage. 


Tags
These are the hidden key word in web page that create 
format for web page and by using these browser arrange 
elements.


There are two kind of tags


Opening Tag 
Use to open an element like:-
<html>, <body>, <p> etc.


Closing Tag
Use to close an element like:-
</html>, </body>, </p> etc.



Some Important Tags.

There is no closing tag.

Element, Tag and Attribute 

What is Tag?
Whenever we have to define an element we use tags.
There are two kinds of tags openig & closing.

What is Element?
Content nested inside tags is know as element.


Different between Element & Tag
Elements & tags are similar to each other but only 
difference is tag define elements and element loaded 
by browser.

For Example:-

<html>
<body>
<div>
	<h2>Heading</h2>
	<p>This is paragraph--------</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>

As you can see we define "Heading element" using <h2> tag.



What is Attribute?  
Attribute provide more functionality to the element.
we always define attribute inside opening tag.
These attribute contain a specific value.

For example:-

Case-1

<html>
<body>
<div class="intro">
<form action="" method="">

<label for="t-1">Content:</label>
<input type="text" name="" id="t-1"/>

</form>
</div>
</body>
</html>

As you can see we use "for" attribute to define a specific id 
for that label.

In "input" tag we use "id" attribute to define label for 
one line text box and values for both the attributes is same.

There are same kind of attribute which only used for few 
tag.

For Example:-

"for" attibute is only used in "label" tag. In the other hand
we have "class" attribute which is used in almost every tag.

Common Tags.

Every element has both Opening & Closing Tag



Heading Tag

The font size of the heading depends upon it tag.

<h1></h1> to <h6></h6>



Paragraph Tag 

Define a paragraph.

<p></p>


Break Tag 

Insert a single line breake.
This tag doesn't use closing ta.

<br>

Nested Elements 

Putting an element inside another element

For example:-
Body & Head Element are nested inside HTML element.

HTML element is called root elements.


Parent & Child Element.

Nested element are known as child elements and parent 
elements are  root element for nested element.

For Example:-
<html>
<body>
<p></p>
</body>
</html>

In this case "Body" Element is parent element and 
"Paragraph" is child element.
